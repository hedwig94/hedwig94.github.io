People out there! We need your help. We found some sites where you can create a logo for your sites, and all of them looked awesome. The only problem is that we are Dutch pricks and don't want to pay for one so we decided to make one ourselfes. But, since we are not that good with digital designing, we thought that it would be a good idea to call you guys for help. So here it is, sent your best Mysterious Eaters logo to info@mysteriouseaters.com and help us. We would be so thankful!

Love,
David, Hermoine and Jane!
